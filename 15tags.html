Some want a cat to cuddle and sit on their laps; others are happy to live with a
very independent cat which spends most of its time outside and doesn’t want too m
uch human interaction.
What is important is that you try to find a cat that will interact with you if yo
u want it to. All cats are not the same and how each individual cat behaves with
you can depend on its inherent personality and early experiences (or lack of expe
riences), which can make it fearful or confident with people and life in general.

</h4>
<h5>
 Owning any pet is good for your heart. Cats in particular lower your stress l
evel—possibly since they don’t require as much effort as dogs—
and lower the amount of anxiety in your life. Petting a cat has a positive calmin
g effect. One study found that over a 10-
year period cat owners were 30 percent less likely to die of a heart attack or st
roke than noncat owners (although this might just be because cat owners are more relaxed and h
ave lower stress in general).
